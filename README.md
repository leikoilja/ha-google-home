## About

This is a custom component that is emerging from the
[community discussion][community-discussion] of a need to be able to retrieve
local google assistant device (like Google Home/Nest etc) authentication
tokens and use those tokens making API calls to Google Home devices.

## Sensors

This component will set up the following sensors:

| Platform | Sample sensor               | Description                                                                |
| -------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sensor` | `sensor.living_room_alarms` | Sensor with a list of alarms from the device                               |
| `sensor` | `sensor.living_room_timers` | Sensor with a list of timers from the device                               |
| `sensor` | `sensor.living_room_device` | Sensor with the IP address for the device, as well as some info attributes |

### Alarms

You can have multiple alarms on your Google Home device. Home Assistant
alarms sensor will represent all of them in the state attributes as a list
`alarms`.
Each of the alarms has the following keys:

| Key              | Value type                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `alarm_id`       | Google Home corresponding ID | Used to identify the alarm                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `fire_time`      | Seconds                      | Raw value coming from Google Home device until the alarm goes off                                                                                                                                       |
| `local_time`     | Time                         | Time when the alarm goes off, in respect to the Home Assistant's timezone                                                                                                                               |
| `local_time_iso` | Time in ISO 8601 standard    | Useful for automations                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `status`         | Status (string)              | The current status of the alarm, either `none`, `set`, `ringing`, `snoozed` or `inactive`                                                                                                               |
| `label`          | Name                         | Name of the alarm, this can be set when making the alarm                                                                                                                                                |
| `recurrence`     | List of integers             | Days of the week when the alarm will go off. Please note, respecting Google set standard, the week starts from Sunday, therefore is denoted by 0. Correspondingly, Monday is 1, Saturday is 6 and so on |

The state value shows the next alarm as a timestring (i.e.: `2021-03-07T15:26:17+01:00`) if there is at least one alarm set, otherwise it is set to `unavailable`.
This matches state format of [standard next alarm sensor](https://companion.home-assistant.io/docs/core/sensors/#next-alarm-sensor) provided by `mobile_app`.

This sensor is formatted to be compatible with the mobile app sensor, e.g. `sensor.phone_next_alarm`.

### Timers

You can have multiple timers on your Google Home device. Home Assistant
timers sensor will represent all of them in the state attributes as a list `timers`.
Each of the timers has the following keys:

| Key              | Value type                   | Description                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `timer_id`       | Google Home corresponding ID | Used to identify the timer                                                   |
| `fire_time`      | Seconds                      | Raw value coming from Google Home device until the timer goes off            |
| `local_time`     | Time                         | Time when the timer goes off, in respect to the Home Assistant's timezone    |
| `local_time_iso` | Time in ISO 8601 standard    | Useful for automations                                                       |
| `duration`       | Seconds                      | Timer duration in seconds                                                    |
| `status`         | Status (string)              | The current status of the timer, either `none`, `set`, `ringing` or `paused` |
| `label`          | Name                         | Name of the timer, this can be set when making the timer                     |

The state value shows the next timer as a timestring (i.e.: `2021-03-07T15:26:17+01:00`) if there is at least one timer set, otherwise it is set to `unavailable`.

### Alarm/Timer status

Both alarms and timers have a property called status. The status of the next alarm/timer (which is used as sensor state value) is also available through sensor state attributes `next_alarm_status` and `next_timer_status` respectively.

| Status    | Meaning                                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `none`    | Alarm or timer does not exist                                      |
| `set`     | Alarm or timer has been set                                        |
| `ringing` | Alarm or timer is ringing right now                                |
| `snoozed` | Alarm was ringing and has been snoozed (only available for alarms) |

Note that timers lack the additional `snoozed` state due to a limitation of the API. If you actually snooze a timer it will just reset itself to the state `set` again.

## Switches

This component will set up the following switches:

| Platform | Sample switch                       | Description                                        |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `switch` | `switch.living_room_do_not_disturb` | Toggle Do Not Disturb mode on a Google Home device |

## Services

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Use Home Assistant v2021.4.0 or above.

### HACS Installation

You can find it in the default HACS repo. Just search `Google Home`.

### Manual Installation

1. Open the directory with your Home Assistant configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`,
   usually `~/.homeassistant/`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory there, you need to create it.

#### Git clone method

This is a preferred method of manual installation, because it allows you to keep the `git` functionality,
allowing you to manually install updates just by running `git pull origin master` from the created directory.

Now you can clone the repository somewhere else and symlink it to Home Assistant like so:

1. Clone the repo.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/leikoilja/ha-google-home.git
```

2. Create the symlink to `google_home` in the configuration directory.
   If you have non standard directory for configuration, use it instead.

```shell
ln -s ha-google-home/custom_components/google_home ~/.homeassistant/custom_components/google_home
```

#### Copy method

1. Download [ZIP](https://github.com/leikoilja/ha-google-home/archive/master.zip) with the code.
2. Unpack it.
3. Copy the `custom_components/google_home/` from the unpacked archive to `custom_components`
   in your Home Assistant configuration directory.

### Integration Setup

- Browse to your Home Assistant instance.
- In the sidebar click on [Configuration](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config).
- From the configuration menu select: [Integrations](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations).
- In the bottom right, click on the [Add Integration](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start?domain=ha-google-home) button.
- From the list, search and select “Google Home”.
- Follow the instruction on screen to complete the set up.
- After completing, the Google Home integration will be immediately available for use.

### Running in Home Assistant Docker container

Make sure that you have your Home Assistant Container network set to `host`, as perscribed in the official docker installation for Home Assistant.

## Diagnostic Data Collection

To make the integration better we are trying to be one step ahead of the game,
working on catching and fixing errors before the user even knows about them.
To do so, we are implementing anonymous diagnostic data collection.
We will never collect any user sensitive data, only integration related
warnings and errors. See related [developers discussion](https://github.com/leikoilja/ha-google-home/discussions/116).

## Troubleshooting

### Collecting useful log data

Here are the steps to generate useful log data:

1. Temporary log level change.
   1. Visit [Home Assistant Developer Services Tool](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/developer_services/).
   2. Choose `Logger: Set level` from the **Service** menu.
   3. Under **Service data** paste the following:
      ```yaml
      custom_components.google_home: debug
      glocaltokens: debug
      ```
   4. Click **Call Service**.
2. Read the log information.
   1. Visit [Home Assistant Logs](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/logs/).
   2. Click **Load Full Home Assistant Log**.
   3. Look for all `google_home` and `glocaltokens` entries.
3. Requesting help with the log information.
   1. Copy the log entries.
   2. Paste them into a discussion forum or bug report. Make sure to use quotation block.

### "Username/Password is incorrect"

If you get this error:

1. First verify you are using the correct Username and Password combination for that Google account.
2. Have you enabled 2 Factor Authentication on that Google account? _If so read the [2 Factor Authentication](#2-factor-authentication--app-passwords) section to continue._
3. We have seen some other custom components break the dependencies causing `google_home` to fail authentication process. For more information please see [this issue](https://github.com/leikoilja/ha-google-home/issues/95).
4. After ruling out #1, #2 and #3 collect relevant logs and open a new issue.

### 2 Factor Authentication / App Passwords

The error "The setting you are looking for is not available for your account" will occur if you do not have 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled on your Google account.

Here are the steps to resolve this issue:

1. Open [Google Account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/).
2. On the top right corner click the profile photo and select the account which you would like to use.
3. Go to [Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) page and make sure you have **2-Step Verification** turned on in **Signing in to Google** section.
4. Then visit [App passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).
   1. Click **Select app** and enter a descriptive name such as _Google Home Integration for Home Assistant_.
   2. Click the **Generate** button.
   3. Copy the password and return to the Google Home Configuration screen.
5. Return to [Integrations](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations/).
   1. Click **Configure** on the Google Home integration.
   2. Enter your Google account username.
   3. Paste the password into the **Google account app password** field.
   4. Click **Submit**.

### Devices found, but not initialized

If the debug logs list your devices, but then show `Successfully initialized 0 Google Home devices` make sure you are logged into the correct Google account.
The account you are using with the integration must have access to your Home.
If unsure, please check what account you are using in the _Google Home_ app and if your devices are listed there.

### Devices found and initialized, but no alarms/timers sensor (#231)

If you can see your devices, and they all seem correct, but the alarms/timers sensors do not appear, or appear empty try restarting the Google Home device, Home Assistant, and reinstalling the integration.
